    <h2>My Story</h2>
    <p>Hi! I'm Jabez Roberts, an aspiring full-stack developer with a passion for building clean, functional, and user-friendly web applications.</p>

    <p>I'm currently completing The App Brewery’s Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp and 100 Days of Code: Python Bootcamp, where I’ve been learning to develop responsive websites, build powerful back-end systems, and automate real-world tasks using Python.</p>

    <p>With a growing portfolio of projects—from dynamic websites to automation scripts—I’m constantly expanding my skills and looking for opportunities to solve real problems with code.</p>

    <p>I enjoy turning ideas into functional products, and I’m particularly interested in working with small businesses, startups, or open-source communities where I can keep learning and contribute meaningfully.</p>

    <p>When I’m not coding, you’ll find me exploring tech trends, learning about AI and automation, or planning my next project.</p>

    <p>Let’s build something great together!</p>
